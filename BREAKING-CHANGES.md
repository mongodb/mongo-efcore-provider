# MongoDB EF Core Provider Breaking Changes

Please note that this provider **does not follow traditional semantic versioning** of limiting breaking changes to major version numbers. This is because the major version number is used to align with releases of Entity Framework Core.

In order to evolve the provider as we introduce new features, we will be using the minor version number for breaking and significant changes to our EF Core provider. Please bear this in mind when upgrading to newer versions of the MongoDB EF Core Provider and ensure you read the release notes and this document for the latest in breaking change information.

## Breaking changes in 8.1.0

This release sees a number of breaking changes deemed necessary to implement the new features and provide for a robust provider experience. They are:

- MongoDB transactions are now required by default
- Guid binary format is changing
- CreateDatabase recommended at start-up
- IMongoClientWrapper interface changes

Please see the following sections for more details.

### MongoDB transactions are now required by default

The MongoDB EF Core Provider 8.1.0 introduces optimistic concurrency support and automatic transactions inside `SaveChanges` and `SaveChangesAsync` to ensure all changes commit together or rollback together as part of the "unit of work" philosophy of Entity Framework Core.

To ensure data integrity transactions are enabled by default in 8.1.0 which means a MongoDB server configuration that supports transactions is required. 

If you are already running MongoDB 5.0 or above in load balanced, sharded, or replica set configurations you should be unaffected by this change.

If, however, you are running MongoDB Server:

- With a version prior to 5.0 you will need to upgrade, this provider is not supported with MongoDB versions prior to 5.0
- In standalone mode (perhaps for local development) you can reconfigure your standalone server to a single-instance replica set
- In a container environment switch to a single-instance replica set container if one is available

To reconfigure a standalone server please follow the [Convert a Standalone MongoDB to a Replica Set guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/).

Alternatively, if you are absolutely sure you do not wish to use transactions, (and therefore not use optimistic concurrency) then you can disable automatic transactions inside `SaveChanges` and `SaveChangesAsync` by setting `Database.AutoTransactionBehavior = AutoTransactionBehavior.Never` on your `DbContext` subclass as part of the setup.

### Guid binary format is changing

The default version for Guid storage in the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver and in prior versions of EF Core Provider is the `CSharpLegacy` binary format which has a number of issues when being read by different drivers. To alleviate this problem we are switching to the `Standard` format which does not suffer from these problems.

If your database exists specifically for your EF provider application and has data already in use we recommend you write a script to convert the Guids from the `CSharpLegacy` to `Standard` format. If your database is already using Guids and is shared with other non-EF Provider applications we recommend you switch them all to the `Standard` Guid format and not rely on any other kind of binary serialization format to avoid such incompatibilities.

Please also note that because the EF Core Provider relies on the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver to perform the low-level operations that the `BsonDefaults.GuidRepresentationMode` will be set to `GuidRepresentationMode.V3` when using the new 8.1.0 or later versions of this provider. Using the MongoDB C# Driver in your application at the same time must also use this mode.

### CreateDatabase recommended at start-up

Previous versions of this provider did not actually create either the database or collections inside `CreateDatabase` or `CreateDatabaseAsync` and instead left them to be implicitly created as documents were written.

With the move to transactional `SaveChanges` this is no longer recommended as it may cause snapshot issues in some server configurations.

Instead it is recommended you call `EnsureCreated` or `EnsureCreatedAsync` during your application start-up. This will call `CreateDatabase` (even if it already exists) which will create any missing expected collections based on the configured metadata for your `DbContext` subclass. This will not affect any existing collections or data and is recommended to avoid a `SaveChanges` or `SaveChangesAsync` operation from causing schema changes during a transaction which can result in snapshot exceptions on some configurations.

### IMongoClientWrapper interface changes

Transactions and database creation work has meant that the `IMongoClientWrapper` interface has changed. It is not recommended you implement this interface yourself as it exists solely to provide EF service registration for the concrete implementation `MongoClientWrapper` class.
